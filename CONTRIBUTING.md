## Setting up local development
- [Fork the project](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/projectman/fork) using fork button in the top right corner.
- Clone the project to your device using `git clone https://github.com/{yourUsername}/projectman.git`
- `npm install` to install the required dependencies
- Type `npm link` to install the content in your global directory. (Your directory will be linked to your global node folder which means if you change anything in the directory it will change inside the global directory as well)
